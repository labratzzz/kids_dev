# kids_dev

This is my project for a particular student that had to write application for preschool children development. 
So I offered him to make a web-application on technologies that I knew and wanted to do some more things with them.

I don't think that I will continue to work on this project.
Some features are incomplete, the project has some security and design issues, but it doesn't have an end goal, so it is senseless to work on it.
